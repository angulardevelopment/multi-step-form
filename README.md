# Multi-step-wizard

## AngularMultiStep

Welcome to **AngularMultiStep**, a project built with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.0. This multi-step wizard is designed to streamline complex forms by breaking them into simple, manageable steps. Whether you're here to learn, improve, or contribute, we‚Äôre thrilled to have you onboard!

### Development Server

To get started locally, run the following command for a dev server:
```bash
ng serve
```
Then, head over to http://localhost:4200/. The app automatically reloads with any code changes you make.


### Code Scaffolding
Need to add a new component, directive, or service? Use Angular‚Äôs CLI to scaffold with ease:
```
ng generate component component-name
ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module
```
### Build
For production-ready builds, use:
```
ng build --prod
```
This compiles your project and stores the artifacts in the dist/ directory.
### Running Unit Tests
Execute unit tests using Karma:

```
ng test
```
### Running End-to-End Tests
For end-to-end testing with Protractor:
```
ng e2e
```
